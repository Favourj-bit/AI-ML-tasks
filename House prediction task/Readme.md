# Housing Price Prediction Model
The project involves building a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various factors such as the median income, housing median age, total rooms, and total bedrooms, etc. The project uses data from a housing dataset and implements the Linear Regression model and Random Forest to make predictions

## Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

## Dataset Used
